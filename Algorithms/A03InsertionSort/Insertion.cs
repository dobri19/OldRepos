            // average case is also quadratic, which makes insertion sort impractical for 
            // sorting large arrays.
            // 6.insertion sort is one of the fastest algorithms for sorting very small arrays, 
            // even faster than quicksort
            // 7.In general, insertion sort will write to the array O(n2) times, whereas selection sort 
            // will write only O(n) times. For this reason selection sort may be preferable in cases 
            // where writing to memory is significantly more expensive than reading
            // 8.The size of list for which insertion sort has the advantage varies by environment 
            // and implementation, but is typically between eight and twenty elements.
